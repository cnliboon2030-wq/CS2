Detailed Methodology

Repository Overview : 
- GradeKeeper is a Python-based console application organized into modular functions. The repository contains:
    * gradekeeper.py – Main program file
    * README.md – Documentation
 - The program separates computation, display, and CRUD operations into functions for clarity and maintainability.

How Core Features Were Implemented : 
- Dual Grading System
    * Users choose between:
        1. Numerical Average (0–100)
        2. GWA (1.00–5.00 weighted system)
    * Two functions handle computation:
        1. calculate_numerical_grade() → simple average
        2. calculate_GWA() → weighted average using units
    * Conditional statements (if condition == 1 or 2) control which system runs.

- Data Storage
    * Three parallel lists store data:
      1. subject_list
      2. grades
      3. units_list
    * Each index represents one subject’s complete data. This simplifies indexing and calculations.

- Honors & Remarks
    * Conditional ranges classify:
      1. Highest Honors / High Honors / Honors (Numerical)
      2. Director’s List (GWA)
      3. Performance remarks
    * This adds meaningful academic feedback beyond raw averages.

- CRUD Operations
    * Four functions manage subject records:
        1. Add
        2. Get
        3. Update
        4. Delete
    * After modifications, the final grade is recalculated to maintain accuracy.

- Technologies Used (With Justification) : 
* Python – Simple syntax, ideal for console applications and structured programming.
* Lists – Flexible and efficient for storing dynamic subject data.
* Conditional Statements & Loops – Used for validation, classification, and record management.
* Random Module – Used to display motivational messages for user engagement.
* Backend–Frontend Communication
    : The application is console-based:
        * Backend: Python logic (calculations and data handling)
        * Frontend: Terminal input/output
    : There is no external database, API, or web interface.

- Key Design Decisions : 
* Used parallel lists instead of classes for simplicity.
* Used global variables for shared access in CRUD functions.
* Designed as a text-based system to focus on logic rather than UI.
* Trade-off: While simple and effective for small-scale use, this design is less scalable than an object-oriented or database-driven system.

- Ethical Considerations : 
* No data is stored externally, ensuring user privacy.
* Grade classifications are rule-based and transparent.
* Input validation prevents incorrect or invalid grading values.

Motivational messages promote positive academic encouragement.
