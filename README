Student Grade Manager : GradeKeeper

Problem Statement
- Students often need an efficient way to compute and monitor their academic performance. Manually calculating averages, determining honors, and tracking subject records can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

What is Gradekeeper? 
- GradeKeeper is a Python-based grade management system that allows users to compute either a numerical average or a GWA (General Weighted Average), display detailed results, generate remarks, and manage subject records using CRUD operations.

Implemented Features
- User Greeting System
- Accepts and displays the student’s name.
- Dual Grading System
    * Option 1: Numerical Grade Average (0–100 scale)
    * Option 2: GWA Calculation (1.00–5.00 scale with units)
- Automatic Computation
    * Computes simple average for numerical grades
    * Computes weighted average for GWA
- Honors & Academic Remarks
    * Highest Honors, High Honors, Honors (Numerical)
    * Director’s List (GWA ≤ 1.50)
    * Performance remarks based on computed average
- Subject Performance Analysis
    * Identifies best and worst performing subjects
- Grade Table Display
    * Displays formatted table of all subjects and grades
- CRUD Operations
    * Add Subject
    * Get Subject Information
    * Update Subject
    * Delete Subject
    * Re-display Grade Table
- Motivational System
    * Displays a random motivational message after computation

Program Flow : 

1, User enters name.

2. User selects grading system (Numerical or GWA).

3. User inputs number of subjects.

4. User enters subject details.

5. Program:
    * Computes average
    * Displays formatted table
    * Shows honors/remarks
    * Identifies best & worst subjects

6. User may manage records using CRUD operations.

7. Program ends when user selects exit.

Planned Inputs and Outputs : 
- Inputs : 
    * Student name
    * Grading type selection (1 or 2)
    * Number of subjects
    * Subject name
    * Grade value
    * Units (for GWA only)
    * CRUD menu selections
- Outputs : 
    * Formatted subject-grade table
    * Final computed average
    * Academic honors (if applicable)
    * Performance remark
    * Best and worst subject
    * Random motivational message

Example Output (Numerical Mode) : 
START
Enter your name: Jam
Enter 1 to calculate your numerical grade, or enter 2 to calculate your GWA: 1
How many subjects do you have? Enter here: 4

Enter name of subject 1: Math
Enter grade for Math: 85
Enter name of subject 2: Science
Enter grade for Science: 90
Enter name of subject 3: English
Enter grade for English: 78
Enter name of subject 4: History
Enter grade for History: 92

Jam, your grades are as follows:
Subjects        | Grade
Math            | 85
Science         | 90
English         | 78
History         | 92
Average         | 86.25

Jam, your final average grade is: 86
Remark: Very Satisfactory
Your best subject is History with a grade of 92!
However, your worst subject is English with a grade of 78.
Keep pushing!

Example Output (GWA Mode)
Enter 2 to calculate your GWA

Enter name of subject 1: Math
Enter units for Math: 3
Enter GWA for Math: 1.25
...

Final Average: 1.42
You're in the Director's List!
Remark: Very Good
